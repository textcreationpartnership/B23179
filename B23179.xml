            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>GReat are the cryings out of ≈øome of you of the Army, and the people of the≈øe Nations, concerning the di≈øsolving of the late Parliament, and it appears with a pretence of a very great zeal, that you have for Liberty, Equity, and Justice, and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good of the three Nations, and you appear in a great fear, that if the people lo≈øe the enjoying of Parliaments, that then they ≈øhall lo≈øe their birth-right and their liberty, both as men, and as Christians; and that equity ≈øhall be laid a≈øide, and that the people mu≈øt be ruled over by a tyrannical power of rebellious men, who≈øe wills mu≈øt be the Lawes that the people must obey. But you ≈øay if the Parliaments be cho≈øen by the people, then in effect the people makes their own Lawes to be governed by, becau≈øe they cho≈øe their Law-makers them≈øelves; and this is</hi> Englands <hi>Birth-right you ≈øay, and it is just and equall that the people ≈øhould enjoy it; and if they do not, then the pre≈øervation of the people of God you ≈øay is lo≈øt, and all good government will cea≈øe, and the people will be made a prey upon, and ≈øo the three Nations will be ruined at once; and therefore ≈øeeing ≈øuch things are like to come to pa≈ø≈øe, if a Parliament cho≈øen by the people be not upheld, ≈øome of you have ≈øaid, you will a≈øsert their Cau≈øe to the last drop of your blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> Friends, It's good to be zealou≈øly affected in a good cau≈øe, and its good that the zeal be according to knowledg, &amp; its precious to have the zeal moderated with the wi≈ødom of God; therefore I exhort you in that life &amp; wi≈ødom which is of Chri≈øt, my Ma≈øter, (who came not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroymens lives, but to ≈øave them) that you would mind the dread &amp; fear of the Lord God, which is the beginning of wi≈ødom, &amp; be moderate, &amp; in coolne≈ø≈øe con≈øider the≈øe things which I ≈øhall declare unto you, which in waiting upon the Lord, he by his ≈øpirit of wi≈ødom &amp; under≈øtanding opened in me, concerning the chu≈øing of Parliaments by the voyces of the people, and I know that you who truly de≈øires the good of Gods people, and that mercy &amp; ju≈øtice might be e≈øtabli≈øhd by righteous Laws, (whereby equity and ju≈øtice might be done unto all without re≈øpect of per≈øons) may clearly ≈øee with Gods witne≈ø≈øe in you (which will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer to my words) that you are not like to ≈øee your de≈øires fulfilled by a Parliament that's cho≈øen by the voyces of the people; mark the rea≈øons; becau≈øe the greater parts of the people that are admitted to chu≈øe Parliament men, are ≈øuch as do not truly de≈øire the good of Gods people, whatever they may profe≈øs in words; and therefore it being in their power to chu≈øe whom they will among them≈øelves (as it is)
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:193352:3"/>becau≈øe mo≈øt voyces carries it; they will chu≈øe ≈øuch men, as are like minded with them≈øelves, that's plain and according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for the world loveth their own, as ≈øaith <hi>John;</hi> and now for proof, that the greater part are not ≈øuch as de≈øire the good of the Lords people, I would have you con≈øider, how that the Scripture ≈øaith, that the flock of Chri≈øt is a little flock; and Chri≈øt ≈øaith, <hi>Strait is the gate and narrow is the way that leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it; but broad is the way that leadeth unto de≈øtruction, and many there be that walk therein, and though I≈ørael be as the ≈øand of the Sea, yet but a remnant ≈øhall be ≈øaved;</hi> now if ye believe the≈øe Scriptures, then may you ≈øee that a Parliament that is cho≈øen by mo≈øt voyces, are not like to act for God, and the good of his people; and it hath been the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the ≈øobere≈øt and hone≈øte≈øt men in ≈øeveral Counties, when they ≈øhould have cho≈øen Parliament men, that they could not chu≈øe ≈øuch a man as they judged would act ≈øingly for the good of the people of God and the Country, becau≈øe they were over-voted by the wild di≈øaffected people, who ≈øometimes have been ≈øtirred up by their Prie≈øts to vote for ≈øuch a man as the Prie≈øts knew would act for their covetous, oppre≈ø≈øing ≈øelf-intere≈øt; and in ≈øome places ≈øome great proud men who de≈øired to be in Authority, hath fea≈øted the people, and ≈øent gifts to them with flatteries, thereby ≈øtriving to get the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to vote for them, promi≈øing them to ≈øtand for their Liberties, when it hath been but to ≈øerve their own ≈øelf-ends, and thus the people have been deceived; and if at any time in ≈øome Counties and places, the hone≈øt ≈øober people have cho≈øen ≈øome hone≈øt men to ≈øerve in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, yet there being ≈øo many in the Parliament that have ≈øought their own honour and gain, that ≈øuch men as were hone≈øt, and would have made ju≈øt Laws, and have acted for Equity and Liberty, they have been hindred; becau≈øe what is done in Parliament, is done by mo≈øt voyces al≈øo, and the hone≈øt party in the Parliament having been the le≈ø≈øer party, have been over voted al≈øo: the light in your con≈øciences will witne≈øs that the≈øe things are true.</p>
            <p>And whereas it is ≈øaid, <hi>That it is</hi> Englands <hi>Birth right that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ≈øhould chu≈øe their own Law-makers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I an≈øwer, then many thou≈øands of men in <hi>England</hi> have been wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, and kept long from their Birth-right; for ≈øuch as are not Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of ≈øome Corporations, or have not free land of their own, are not permitted to chu≈øe Parliament men, (mark that) though they be farre more hone≈øt and under≈øtanding men then many that are free of ≈øuch Corporations, and have ≈øuch land; ≈øo that its but a part of the people
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:193352:3"/>that mu≈øt chu≈øe Law-makers; and further, he that hath free land worth forty ≈øhillings the year in ≈øeveral Counties, he may give his voyce in ≈øeveral Counties where his land lieth, for ≈øeveral Parliament men, when as he that hath land but in one County, cannot have the ≈øame priviledge, though he be a far more hone≈øt man; and he that's a free-man of that Corporation, that findes a Parliament man, or men; and hath free lands in the country al≈øo, he may chu≈øe both in the one, and other; but he that is not free of ≈øuch a place, he may not have the like priviledge, though he be more hone≈øter then the other; and this aro≈øe from the ≈øame ground, that negative voyces aro≈øe from; And it hath been the manner and cu≈øtome of <hi>England,</hi> to call and chu≈øe many wi≈øe men, after the fle≈øh, &amp; many mighty, and noble men (≈øo called) to be Parliament men, that ≈øo we ≈øee the calling &amp; chu≈øing of Parliaments in <hi>England,</hi> hath bin exactly contrary to Gods calling, &amp; chu≈øing; Read 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26. (&amp; therefore ≈øuch Parliaments are not like to act for God &amp; the good of his people, but again≈øt them) But that which God hath called and cho≈øen, ≈øhall confound and bring to nought the wi≈øe and the mighty, and the noble things (≈øo called of the world) (and this the Lord will bring to pa≈øs) that ≈øo no fle≈øh may glory in his pre≈øence; Read 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.27, 28, 29. And likewi≈øe the chu≈øing of Parliament men, according to the cu≈øtom of <hi>England</hi> (which is called its Birth-right) ≈øtands in re≈øpect of per≈øons, and not in equality; for the rich covetous oppre≈ø≈øing men, who oppre≈øseth the poor, they have the only power to chu≈øe Law-makers, and they will chu≈øe to be ≈øure ≈øuch as will uphold them in their oppre≈ø≈øion; and the poor man that is oppre≈ø≈øed, though he have no power allowed him to chu≈øe, yet he mu≈øt be ≈øubject to the Lawes which they make who are his oppre≈ø≈øors, or el≈øe he is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Rebell; ≈øo what right think ye is the oppre≈ø≈øed like to have, when his oppre≈ø≈øors chu≈øe the men that are to be Judges of his cau≈øe; and thus the rich men oppre≈øs the poor, and draw them before their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment feats, as they did in <hi>james</hi> his dayes; <hi>James</hi> 2.6. The≈øe things being con≈øidered, ye may ≈øee the unequalne≈ø≈øe and partiality that hath been in chu≈øing of Parliaments, according to <hi>Englands</hi> cu≈øtom, and how unlike it is that a Parliament ≈øo cho≈øen ≈øhould make <hi>England</hi> a free Nation, ≈øeeing the great oppre≈øsors of the land <hi>(viz.)</hi> Prie≈øts, and Lawyers, and the great wicked, covetous, per≈øecuting men are ≈øo much concerned in the chu≈øing them; ≈øo that if Parliaments ≈øo cho≈øen ≈øhould continue, the people of the Lord are not like to be ≈øet free from their oppre≈ø≈øion, (though Parliaments and Rulers have been made to do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good things by a power which many of them ≈øcarce knew) but the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:193352:4"/>Lord hath a further thing yet to do in the Nations, then either Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors or Parliaments would ≈øubmit unto; therefore the Lord hath thrown them by, but they had fir≈øt a day of tryal given them, and now is the Lord trying others, and if they will not do his work, in breaking every yoke, and letting the oppre≈øsed go free, God will a≈øsuredly break them with a greater de≈øtruction then came upon tho≈øe before them; Therefore let your moderation be known unto all men, for the Lord is at hand; and thir≈øt not after blood, le≈øt the Lord give ye blood to drink; and we know that Kings, and Protectors, and Parliaments have made fair pretences, and have given them≈øelves fine titles, and have pleaded that they had a ju≈øt right to, and a nece≈ø≈øity for their authority, and ≈øought to get into the affections of the people by ≈ømooth words and large promi≈øes, to carry on their own de≈øign, but their hearts were not right before the Lord; and therefore he broke them, and their titles; and know that the people that fear God, they matter not titles, and high names, but they look for righteous actions to be brought forth; &amp; many ≈øees that a Parliament that was cho≈øe by the mo≈øt voyces of the outwardly rich people, were not like to act righteou≈øly; and therefore they are willing to wait to ≈øee what the Lord will do by others, and we ≈øee that people have been in great blindne≈øs, in contending for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments ≈øo cho≈øen; ≈øo let this wi≈ødom be learned and lived in, which is better then the ≈øtrength of fools, who oft peri≈øh in their pa≈ø≈øion and folly.</p>
            <p>And now friends in the Army and Committee that have turned out the Parliament, dread ye the Lord God, and mind the equall, ju≈øt, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble principle of God in you, which hath ≈øtirred again≈øt tyranny and oppre≈ø≈øion, and make it not your bu≈øine≈øs to declare onely for freedom, as ≈øome before you did, and did not the thing they declared for; but in the fear and wi≈ødom of the Lord, go ye on to act for the good of all his creatures, and ≈øeek not your own honours, but ≈øingly do the ≈øame both for your friends and enemies, that you would have them do for you if they were in authority as ye are; and untill ye come to this, ye are not like to pro≈øper; the Lord abhorreth the lying, flattering, dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, deceitful tongue and heart; and the people al≈øo have been wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with fair words, becau≈øe the actions have been wanting that ≈øhould have accompanied the ≈øaid words.</p>
            <p>Remember how you have cryed out again≈øt the oppre≈ø≈øion of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced maintenance for teachers, and now ye are tried, and have power given you to break that oppre≈ø≈øion down, which ≈øome of you I ≈øay have de≈øired others to do; therefore abu≈øe not your power, but leave
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:193352:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>the people free to maintain their own Teachers; (mark) The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters that Chri≈øt ≈øends forth, they have no need of you in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, as to provide food and raiment for them, for their heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowes that they have need of tho≈øe things, and provides it for them without an outward Law to compell it, that ≈øo they lack not any thing; and that Teacher that will not con≈øent to this, he ≈øerveth not the Lord Je≈øus, but his own belly; and that is his God; and ≈øuch a one can never profit the people, and (mark) if ye ≈øhould take away tythes, &amp; command by a Law any other maintenance from us for Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, that would be the ≈øame Tyranny and oppre≈ø≈øion in the nature and ground of it, that tithes were, and we mu≈øt bear our te≈øtimony again≈øt it al≈øo, and our lives, or e≈øtates, or both mu≈øt yet ≈øuffer; therefore if ye do thus, you leave us in the ≈øame bondage as before; And let Lawes be provided, that are righteous, ju≈øt, and equall, according to that of God in the con≈øcience, and let ≈øuch be impowred to execute them that will hear and determine cau≈øes freely, according to righteou≈øne≈øs; and let cau≈øes of difference between man and man be heard in every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and when by plain proof of 2 or 3 witne≈ø≈øes (without tran≈øgre≈ø≈øing Chri≈øts doctrine) it come to be manife≈øted who have done the wrong, then let the executioners of the Law be impowred to cau≈øe the party or parties, to re≈øtore for the wrong that is done according to equity, that ≈øo this abominable oppre≈ø≈øion about the Law &amp; Lawyers may be broken down; and thunder down all ungodly gamings, and ≈øhowes, whereby the fooli≈øh wilde people are cheated of their monies, and ≈øpends away their precious time to the di≈øhonour of the pure God.</p>
            <p>And let the people of the Lord have their liberty, to ≈øpeak his word freely, where and when his ≈øpirit leads them and gives them utterance; and let the Law take hold on ≈øuch as would wrong any mans per≈øon or e≈øtate.</p>
            <p>And let the dread of the Lord be upon your ≈øpirits, and wait in his light, to receive his wi≈ødom, that therein you may be ordered in the particular, and in it order all things to his glory, and that ye may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all that which is ≈øtanding, which is contrary to the will of God.</p>
            <p>And meddle not to e≈øtabli≈øh Religion and Teachers by an outward Law, for verily if ye do, ye will be broken; Let that alone to Chri≈øt, who≈øe work it is: Con≈øider all that went before you of late years, that would be medling with ≈øuch things, the Lord broke them to pieces, and they were warned in their day, as ye are now. And let not your many victories which ye have obtained, nor your being pre≈øerved in ≈øo many overturnings (wherein ye have been made In≈øtrumental) nor your
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:193352:5"/>≈øtrength, courage, nor wi≈ødom puff ye up; for thus ≈øaith the Lord God, even as earthen ve≈ø≈øels are in the hands of a Potter, (who have power to da≈øh them one again≈øt another, until they be broken, or to break them in pieces with another thing, that appears more weake then they) even ≈øo are you in my hand ≈øaith the Lord; and I can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found your wi≈ødom, and take away your courage, and ≈ømite you with faintne≈øs, and dauntedne≈øs of ≈øpirit in the twinkling of an eye; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ≈øeek not your ≈øelves, for if you do, your day ≈øhall be but ≈øhort.</p>
            <p>Remember you of the Army had power once before to have acted for the good of your Nation, but the ≈øubtilty in ≈øome who ≈øought them≈øelves (whom God hath ≈øince bla≈øted) beguiled you, and (mark) ≈øome of you ≈øold your power for Commi≈ø≈øions, and others for nothing but flattering words, and ≈øo betrayed your own integrity, and the cau≈øe of your Country; and now you have power again, do not abu≈øe it; ≈øerve not the lu≈øts nor the ≈øelf-intere≈øt of any man or men what≈øoever, but ≈øerve the Lord and your Generation faithfully; mark, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent to deceit, and make an agreement with death, through fear or any ≈øelf-end what≈øoever, God will break that agreement, and bring ≈øhame upon you for it. And Friends, there is a lofty, proud, ≈øelf-≈øeeking ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit yet among≈øt many of you, which if you cea≈øe not from, it will be the cau≈øe of your de≈øtruction; and truly, if you provoke the Lord to break you, it will be more heavie &amp; terrible then the breaking of tho≈øe that were before you; therefore let the Lord be minded, and linger not about things, but be valiant, and act faithfully for the ju≈øt liberty of all, without re≈øpect of per≈øons, and let revenge be forgotten, and this will overcome your enemies, and make you truly honourable in the hearts of all people. This is your day, pri≈øe it, And let your deeds make it manife≈øt to the people, that you have not ≈øought your ≈øelves, (in this which you have done) but the general good of all, and then you will need the fewer words to prove your enemies lyars, who have accu≈øed you to be ≈øelf-≈øeekers. And now woe is coming both upon Teachers, Rulers and people that are in the good words, but out of the good deeds and life; and the Eternal God who is the light, will break, ≈øhatter, confound and over-turn, untill the good life come up and be ≈øet on the top of all; and now the name of truth only will be too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a covering, for it is the nature of truth it ≈øelf that will be able to cover, and to be a ≈øure hiding-place in this the day of the wrath of the Lamb.</p>
